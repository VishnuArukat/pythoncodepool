#Introduction

All programs are written with some comments that will give you a slight idea about the code.If you want to know more about it you can read the following.

##Backtracking Problems

*Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate c ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that c cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.*

* HAMILTONIAN CYCLE
* COLORING PROBLEM
* KNIGHT TOUR PROBLEM
* MAZE PROBLEM
