                              ``` Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.```
    ```This python codepool contains some programming chalenges and some applications and games that i developed.I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code.```
